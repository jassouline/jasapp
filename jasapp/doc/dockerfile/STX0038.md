# STX0038 - Specify Versions with `dnf install` and `dnf module install`

## Description

When using `dnf install` or `dnf module install` in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's crucial to specify the version of the package or module you want to install.

-   For `dnf install`, instead of `dnf install -y <package>`, use `dnf install -y <package>-<version>` or `dnf install -y <package_file>.rpm`.
-   For `dnf module install`, instead of `dnf module install -y <module>`, use `dnf module install -y <module>:<version>`.

The same recommendations apply to the `microdnf` command, which is a minimal version of `dnf` often used in space-constrained environments.

## Why It Matters

-   **Reproducibility:** Pinning versions ensures that your Docker builds are reproducible. Unpinned versions can lead to different package versions being installed across builds, causing inconsistencies and potential breakages if a new, incompatible version of a package is released.
-   **Stability:** By specifying a version, you guarantee that your application is built with the dependencies it has been tested with, improving stability.
-   **Security:** Avoids unexpected installation of vulnerable versions that might be introduced in later releases.

## How to Fix

Modify your `RUN` instruction to include the desired version number after the package or module name, using the appropriate separator (`-` for packages, `:` for modules).

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install -y httpd
```

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf module install -y nodejs
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install -y httpd-2.4.6
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install -y local-package.rpm
```

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf module install -y nodejs:14
```
