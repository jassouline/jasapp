# STX0040 - Do Not Use `ONBUILD`, `FROM`, or `MAINTAINER` Inside `ONBUILD`

## Description

The `ONBUILD` instruction in a Dockerfile adds a trigger instruction to be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build. The trigger will be executed in the context of the downstream build, as if it had been inserted immediately after the `FROM` instruction in the downstream Dockerfile.

However, you cannot chain `ONBUILD` instructions using `ONBUILD ONBUILD`. Additionally, you cannot use `ONBUILD` to trigger `FROM` or `MAINTAINER` instructions.

## Why It Matters

-   **`ONBUILD` Chaining:** Chaining `ONBUILD` instructions is not supported and will result in a build error.
-   **`FROM` and `MAINTAINER` in `ONBUILD`:** Using `ONBUILD FROM` or `ONBUILD MAINTAINER` is not allowed and will result in a build error.

## How to Fix

Avoid using `ONBUILD ONBUILD`, `ONBUILD FROM`, and `ONBUILD MAINTAINER` in your Dockerfiles. You can use any other valid instruction within an `ONBUILD` trigger.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
ONBUILD ONBUILD RUN echo hello  # Invalid: ONBUILD chaining
ONBUILD FROM ubuntu:latest     # Invalid: ONBUILD FROM
ONBUILD MAINTAINER john.doe@example.com  # Invalid: ONBUILD MAINTAINER
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
ONBUILD RUN echo hello          # Valid ONBUILD instruction
ONBUILD ADD . /app             # Valid ONBUILD instruction
FROM ubuntu:latest
MAINTAINER john.doe@example.com
```
