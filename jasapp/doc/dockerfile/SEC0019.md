# SEC0019 - Avoid Configuring `apt` or `apt-get` to Allow Unauthenticated Packages

## Description

This rule detects the use of `apt` or `apt-get` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that allow the installation of unauthenticated packages. Specifically, it checks for the presence of the `--allow-unauthenticated` flag.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Installing unauthenticated packages can lead to the installation of malicious or compromised software, potentially compromising the security of the container and the host system.
-   **Package Integrity:** Unauthenticated packages may not have been verified by the distribution's maintainers, increasing the risk of using tampered or outdated software.

## How to Fix

-   **Avoid using `--allow-unauthenticated`:** If possible, remove the `--allow-unauthenticated` option and rely on properly signed and authenticated packages.
-   **Verify package sources:** Ensure that you are using trusted and verified package repositories.
-   **Use `apt-get update`:** Always run `apt-get update` before `apt-get install` to ensure you have the latest package lists and signatures.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get install --allow-unauthenticated curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `apt` and `apt-get` with the `--allow-unauthenticated` flag.
-   Always ensure that you are installing packages from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified.
