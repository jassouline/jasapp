# STX0034 - Use `zypper clean` After `zypper install` or `zypper in`

## Description

After installing packages with `zypper install` or `zypper in` in a Dockerfile `RUN` instruction, it's recommended to clean the `zypper` cache to reduce the image size. This can be done by adding `zypper clean` or `zypper cc` to the same `RUN` instruction after the installation command.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** The `zypper` cache can consume significant disk space. Cleaning it after installation keeps the image smaller.
-   **Reproducibility:** Ensures that each layer is minimized and doesn't include unnecessary cached files.

## How to Fix

Add `zypper clean` or `zypper cc` after your `zypper install` or `zypper in` command in the same `RUN` instruction.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper install -y httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper install -y httpd && zypper clean
```

Or, to update specific package : 

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper in -y httpd && zypper cc
```
