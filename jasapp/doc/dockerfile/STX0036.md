# STX0036 - Use the `-y` Switch with `dnf install`

## Description

When using `dnf install`, `dnf localinstall`, or `dnf groupinstall` in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's essential to include the `-y` (or `--assumeyes`) flag. This also applies to the `microdnf` command, which is a minimal version of `dnf` often used in space-constrained environments. This flag automatically answers "yes" to any prompts that might appear during the installation process, ensuring that the build doesn't hang waiting for user input.

## Why It Matters

-   **Automation:** Docker builds should be fully automated. Manual intervention during the build process defeats this purpose.
-   **Efficiency:**  Using `-y` prevents builds from hanging indefinitely, waiting for a response that will never come in a non-interactive environment.
-   **Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent and predictable build behavior.

## How to Fix

Add the `-y` (or `--assumeyes`) flag to your `dnf install`, `dnf localinstall`, or `dnf groupinstall` command within the `RUN` instruction. The same applies when using `microdnf`.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install -y httpd
```
Also works with microdnf
```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN microdnf install -y httpd
```
