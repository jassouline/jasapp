# SEC0017 - Avoid Disabling TLS Certificate Validation with `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`

## Description

This rule detects if the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable is set to `0` within an `ENV` instruction in a Dockerfile. Setting `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to `0` disables TLS certificate validation for Node.js applications, which can pose a significant security risk.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Disabling certificate validation allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept TLS connections and present a fake certificate, potentially leading to data breaches or malware injection.
-   **Data Integrity:** Without certificate validation, the authenticity and integrity of data exchanged over TLS cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Remove the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` setting:** If you don't need to disable certificate validation, simply remove the `ENV` instruction that sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to `0`.
-   **Set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to `1` (or leave it undefined):** To enforce certificate validation, either set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to `1` or don't define it at all (as `1` is the default behavior).
-   **Use a trusted certificate:** If you are dealing with self-signed certificates, add the certificate to the container's trust store instead of disabling validation.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM node:16

ENV NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:16

# NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED is not set, so it defaults to 1 (enabled)
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM node:16

ENV NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=1
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable.
-   Refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_tls_reject_unauthorizedvalue) for more information on TLS certificate verification in Node.js.
