# STX0022 - COPY --from Cannot Reference Its Own FROM Alias

## Description

The `COPY --from` instruction in Dockerfiles must not reference the alias defined by the immediately preceding `FROM` instruction. This is because a stage cannot copy from itself.

## Why It Matters

- Attempting to copy from the same stage results in a build error.
- This rule ensures that multi-stage builds are constructed correctly.

## Severity

- **Error**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest AS builder
COPY --from=builder /app /app
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest AS builder
FROM ubuntu:latest AS runtime
COPY --from=builder /app /app
```

Alternatively, using stade indices

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=0 /app /app
```
