# STX0021 - COPY --from Must Reference a Defined FROM Alias

## Description

The `COPY --from` instruction in Dockerfiles should reference a valid `FROM` alias or a stage index defined earlier in the file. This ensures that the source of the files is properly specified.

## Why It Matters

- Referencing an undefined alias or an invalid stage index can lead to build failures.
- Properly defining aliases or stage indices ensures that multi-stage builds work as expected.

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest AS builder
FROM ubuntu:latest
COPY --from=invalid_alias /app /app
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest AS builder
FROM ubuntu:latest
COPY --from=builder /app /app
```

Alternatively, using stade indices

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
FROM ubuntu:latest
COPY --from=0 /app /app
```
