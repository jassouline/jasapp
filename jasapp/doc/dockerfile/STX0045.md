# STX0045 - Avoid Superfluous Labels

## Description

This rule checks for superfluous labels in `LABEL` instructions within a Dockerfile. It can be configured to operate in either strict or non-strict mode.

-   **Strict mode:** Only labels specified in the `allowed_labels` set are permitted. Any other label will trigger an error.
-   **Non-strict mode (default):**  All labels are permitted, and no errors will be reported.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** While labels themselves don't significantly impact image size, using unnecessary labels can bloat the image metadata.
-   **Clarity:**  Using only relevant labels improves clarity and maintainability.
-   **Compliance:**  Organizations may have policies that mandate specific labels and restrict the use of others.

## How to Fix

-   In strict mode, ensure that only allowed labels are used in `LABEL` instructions. Remove any superfluous labels.

## Example

Assuming `allowed_labels` is set to `["maintainer", "version"]` and `strict_labels` is set to `True`:

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

LABEL maintainer="test" version="1.0" extra="label"
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

LABEL maintainer="test" version="1.0"
```

## Severity

-   **Info**

## Configuration

This rule is configurable. When creating an instance of `STX0045`, you can pass:

-   `allowed_labels`: A list of allowed label names (used in strict mode).
-   `strict_labels`: A boolean flag indicating whether to operate in strict mode (`True`) or non-strict mode (`False`).

```python
# Strict mode: only allow "maintainer" and "version" labels
rule_instance = STX0045(allowed_labels=["maintainer", "version"], strict_labels=True)

# Non-strict mode: allow any label
rule_instance = STX0045()
```
