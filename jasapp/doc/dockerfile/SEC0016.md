# SEC0016 - Avoid Disabling HTTPS Certificate Validation with `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY`

## Description

This rule detects if the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable is set to `0` within an `ENV` instruction in a Dockerfile. Setting `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` to `0` disables HTTPS certificate validation for Python applications, which can pose a significant security risk.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Disabling certificate validation allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept HTTPS connections and present a fake certificate, potentially leading to data breaches or malware injection.
-   **Data Integrity:** Without certificate validation, the authenticity and integrity of data exchanged over HTTPS cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Remove the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY=0` setting:**  If you don't need to disable certificate validation, simply remove the `ENV` instruction that sets `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` to `0`.
-   **Set `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` to `1` (or leave it undefined):**  To enforce certificate validation, either set `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` to `1` or don't define it at all (as `1` is the default behavior).
-   **Use a trusted certificate:** If you are dealing with self-signed certificates, add the certificate to the container's trust store instead of disabling validation.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

ENV PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY=0
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

# PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY is not set, so it defaults to 1 (enabled)
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

ENV PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY=1
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable.
-   Refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.verify_mode) for more information on HTTPS certificate verification in Python.
