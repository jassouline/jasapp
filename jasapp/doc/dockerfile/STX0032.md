# STX0032 - Use `--non-interactive` Switch with `zypper` Commands

## Description

When using `zypper` commands that modify the system in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile (such as `install`, `in`, `remove`, `rm`, `source-install`, `si`, `patch`), it's essential to include the `--non-interactive` flag (or its equivalent short flags like `-n`, `-y`, `--no-confirm`). This flag prevents the command from prompting for user input, ensuring that the build doesn't hang waiting for an interactive response.

## Why It Matters

-   **Automation:** Docker builds should be fully automated. Manual intervention during the build process defeats this purpose.
-   **Efficiency:** Using `--non-interactive` prevents builds from hanging indefinitely, waiting for input in a non-interactive environment.
-   **Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent and predictable build behavior.

## How to Fix

Add the `--non-interactive` flag (or equivalent short flags) to your `zypper` command within the `RUN` instruction.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper install httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper --non-interactive install httpd
```
You can also use :
```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper -n install httpd
```
