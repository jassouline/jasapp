# PERF0004 - Avoid Multiple Consecutive `RUN` Instructions

## Description

This rule detects multiple consecutive `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile. While not technically an error, it's often more efficient to combine multiple `RUN` commands into a single one to reduce the number of layers in the resulting image.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** Each `RUN` instruction creates a new layer in the Docker image. Multiple consecutive `RUN` instructions can lead to larger image sizes.
-   **Build Performance:**  More layers can lead to slower build times, especially when many layers have to be rebuilt frequently.

## How to Fix

Consolidate multiple consecutive `RUN` instructions into a single `RUN` instruction, using `&&` to chain commands together.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN apt-get install -y git
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl && \
    apt-get install -y git
```
