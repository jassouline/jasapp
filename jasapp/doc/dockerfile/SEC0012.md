# SEC0012 - Avoid Potentially Dangerous Shell Commands in `RUN`

## Description

This rule detects the use of potentially dangerous shell commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile. These commands can have unintended consequences or be used maliciously if the container is compromised.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Some shell commands, when used carelessly, can create security vulnerabilities. For example, writing to `/dev/null` might seem harmless, but could mask errors that should be investigated. Using `/dev/random` or `/dev/zero` directly can lead to unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion.
-   **Image Bloat:** Commands like `cat /dev/zero > file` can create excessively large files, leading to larger image sizes.
-   **Unpredictable Behavior:**  Commands like `dd if=/dev/random` can be very slow and unpredictable, potentially causing build timeouts or instability.

## How to Fix

-   **Avoid dangerous commands:** Carefully review the commands used in your `RUN` instructions and avoid those that are known to be potentially dangerous unless you have a very good reason to use them and understand the risks.
-   **Use safer alternatives:**  If you need to perform a specific task, explore safer alternatives. For example, instead of writing to `/dev/null`, consider logging to standard output or a file within the container.
-   **Validate inputs and outputs:** If you must use potentially dangerous commands, thoroughly validate any inputs to these commands and carefully consider their potential impact on the container and the host system.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN cat /dev/zero > /tmp/large_file
RUN dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/random_data count=100
RUN cat anyfile > /dev/null
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# If you need a large file, create it with a specific size and content
RUN fallocate -l 1G /tmp/large_file

# If you need random data, consider generating it within your application or use a more controlled approach
RUN head -c 100 /dev/urandom > /tmp/random_data

# If you need to discard output, consider logging properly instead of redirecting to /dev/null
RUN your_command 2>&1 | tee logfile.txt
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule currently detects the following potentially dangerous patterns:
    -   `cat /dev/zero >`
    -   `dd if=/dev/random`
    -   `dd if=/dev/zero`
    -   `> /dev/null`
-   The list of dangerous commands can be expanded based on your specific security requirements.
-   Always carefully consider the security implications of the commands you run inside a Docker container.
