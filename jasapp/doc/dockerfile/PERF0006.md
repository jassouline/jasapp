# PERF0006 - Use `COPY --chown` Instead of Separate `RUN chown`

## Description

This rule suggests using the `--chown` flag with the `COPY` instruction instead of using a separate `RUN` instruction with the `chown` command. This optimization is available since Docker version 19.03.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** Using `COPY --chown` can reduce the number of layers in your Docker image, resulting in a smaller image size. Each `RUN` instruction creates a new layer, whereas `COPY --chown` combines the copy and ownership change into a single layer.
-   **Build Performance:** Fewer layers can potentially lead to faster build times.

## How to Fix

Replace separate `COPY` and `RUN chown` instructions with a single `COPY` instruction that uses the `--chown` flag.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY source /dest
RUN chown user:group /dest
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY --chown=user:group source /dest
```
