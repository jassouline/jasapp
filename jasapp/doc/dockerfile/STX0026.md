# STX0026 - Do Not Use `apt` in RUN Instructions

## Description

The `apt` command is primarily designed for end-user interaction and its output may change between versions. For scripting purposes, like in Dockerfiles, it's recommended to use `apt-get` or `apt-cache` instead.

## Why It Matters

- `apt` output is not guaranteed to be stable and can change, potentially breaking Docker builds that rely on specific output formatting.
- `apt-get` and `apt-cache` provide more stable interfaces for scripting.

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN apt update && apt install -y curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

Or :

```dockerfile
RUN apt-cache search curl
```
