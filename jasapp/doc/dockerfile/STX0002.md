# STX0002 - Avoid Using the 'latest' Tag in Docker Images

## Description

This rule checks if the `FROM` instruction in a Dockerfile uses the `latest` tag for the base image. Using the `latest` tag can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in your builds and deployments.

## Why It Matters

- **Reproducibility:** The `latest` tag points to the most recent version of the base image, which can change unexpectedly. This can cause builds to fail or produce unexpected results.
- **Maintainability:** Using specific image versions improves the maintainability of your Dockerfiles and makes it easier to track changes and troubleshoot issues.
- **Security:** Using the `latest` tag can introduce unexpected security vulnerabilities into your images.

## How to Fix

Replace the `latest` tag with a specific version tag for the base image. For example:

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
```

## Severity
