# STX0033 - Do Not Use `zypper dist-upgrade` or `zypper dup`

## Description

The commands `zypper dist-upgrade` and `zypper dup` should not be used in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile. These commands are used to upgrade the entire distribution to a new version, which is generally not recommended in the context of a Docker container.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** `zypper dist-upgrade` and `zypper dup` can significantly increase the size of the Docker image by installing or upgrading a large number of packages.
-   **Reproducibility:**  Distribution upgrades can introduce unexpected changes and breakages. It's better to explicitly manage package versions within a specific distribution release.
-   **Security:** Uncontrolled upgrades might introduce security vulnerabilities.

## How to Fix

Instead of using `zypper dist-upgrade` or `zypper dup`, use `zypper update` to update packages within the current distribution release, or explicitly install/update specific packages with pinned versions.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper dup
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper update
```
Or, to update specific package : 
```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper install -y package_name:<version>
```
