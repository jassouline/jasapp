# SEC0013 - Avoid Disabling Certificate Validation with `curl`

## Description

This rule detects the use of `curl` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that disable certificate validation. Specifically, it checks for the presence of the `--insecure` or `-k` flags without the corresponding `--fail` or `-f` flags.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Disabling certificate validation allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept the connection and serve a malicious file instead of the intended one.
-   **Data Integrity:** Without certificate validation, the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded files cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Remove insecure flags:** Remove the `--insecure` or `-k` flags from the `curl` command.
-   **Use secure flags:** Ensure that `--fail` or `-f` flags are present when using `--insecure` or `-k` to make `curl` fail on certificate errors.
-   **Use a trusted certificate:** If you are using a self-signed certificate, add the certificate to the container's trust store instead of disabling validation.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN curl -k https://example.com -o file.zip
```
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN curl --insecure https://example.com -o file.zip
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN curl --fail https://example.com -o file.zip
```

Or, if using a self-signed certificate:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY my-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
RUN update-ca-certificates

RUN curl https://example.com -o file.zip
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `curl` with insecure flags. Other tools for downloading files might have different options for disabling certificate validation.
-   Always ensure that you are downloading files from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded files is verified.
