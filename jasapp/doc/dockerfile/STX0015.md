# STX0015 - Avoid Additional Packages by Using `--no-install-recommends`

## Description

When using `apt-get install` in Dockerfiles, it is recommended to include the `--no-install-recommends` flag. This prevents the installation of additional, unnecessary packages, reducing image size and improving build efficiency.

## Why It Matters

- The `apt-get install` command installs recommended packages by default, which may not always be needed.
- Avoiding unnecessary packages reduces the image size and potential vulnerabilities.
- Using the `--no-install-recommends` flag ensures that only explicitly specified packages are installed.

## Severity

- **Info**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install --no-install-recommends curl
```

### Alternative Correct Usage

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install -o APT::Install-Recommends=false curl
```
