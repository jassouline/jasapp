# STX0056 - Use Only One `ENTRYPOINT` Instruction

## Description

This rule checks for multiple `ENTRYPOINT` instructions in a Dockerfile. While technically not an error, having multiple `ENTRYPOINT` instructions is redundant as only the last `ENTRYPOINT` instruction will take effect when the container starts.

## Why It Matters

-   **Clarity:** Using only one `ENTRYPOINT` instruction makes the Dockerfile's intention clearer.
-   **Maintainability:** Avoids confusion and potential errors when modifying the Dockerfile.

## How to Fix

Consolidate multiple `ENTRYPOINT` instructions into a single one. If you need to execute multiple commands, use a shell script and call it from the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1"]
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param2"]
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param2"]
```

## Severity

  - **Error**
