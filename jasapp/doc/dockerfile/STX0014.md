# STX0014 - Use `-y` Switch in `apt-get install`

## Description

When using `apt-get install` in Dockerfiles, it is recommended to include the `-y` switch or equivalent options to avoid manual input during the installation process. This ensures non-interactive builds and prevents hangs due to prompts for user confirmation.

## Why It Matters

- Automated builds require non-interactive commands to succeed.
- Missing the `-y` option can cause the build to hang indefinitely, waiting for user input.
- Adding the `-y` switch ensures smooth, predictable execution of the build process.

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install -y curl
```

## Supported Flags
The rule considers the following flags as valid alternatives to `-y`:

- `--yes`
- `--assume-yes`
- `-qq` (quiet mode with sufficient q flags)
- `--quiet=2`
