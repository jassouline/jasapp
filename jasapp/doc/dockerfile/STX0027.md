# STX0027 - Pin Versions in `gem install`

## Description

When using `gem install` in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's crucial to specify the version of the gem you want to install. Instead of `gem install <gem>`, use `gem install <gem>:<version>`.

## Why It Matters

-   **Reproducibility:** Pinning versions ensures that your Docker builds are reproducible. Unpinned versions can lead to different gem versions being installed across builds, causing inconsistencies and potential breakages if a new, incompatible version of a gem is released.
-   **Stability:** By specifying a version, you guarantee that your application is built with the dependencies it has been tested with, improving stability.

## How to Fix

Modify your `RUN` instruction to include the desired version number after the gem name, separated by a colon.

## Example

### Non-compliant Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.7

RUN gem install rails
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.7

RUN gem install rails:6.1.4
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:2.7

RUN gem install -v '>= 1.0' --no-document rails && gem install bundler:2.5.0
```
