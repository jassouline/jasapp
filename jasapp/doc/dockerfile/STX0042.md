# STX0042 - Avoid `COPY` to Relative Destination Without `WORKDIR`

## Description

When using the `COPY` instruction in a Dockerfile, it's essential to ensure that the destination path is absolute if a `WORKDIR` has not been previously defined. Copying to a relative destination without a `WORKDIR` can lead to unpredictable behavior, as the working directory in the intermediate containers might not be what you expect.

## Why It Matters

-   **Predictability:** Using absolute paths ensures that your files are copied to the intended location, regardless of the context or any previous instructions that might have changed the working directory.
-   **Maintainability:**  Explicitly setting the `WORKDIR` makes the Dockerfile easier to understand and maintain, as the context for each `COPY` instruction is clear.
-   **Portability:**  Avoids issues that can arise when building the image in different environments where the default working directory might vary.

## How to Fix

1.  Always set a `WORKDIR` before using `COPY` instructions with relative paths.
2.  If you don't want to set a `WORKDIR`, use absolute paths for the destination in your `COPY` instructions.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY source_file relative_dest
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY source_file relative_dest
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY source_file /absolute/dest
```
