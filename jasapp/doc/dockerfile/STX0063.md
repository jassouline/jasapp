# STX0063 - Avoid `USER` Before `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, or `ADD`

## Description

This rule detects the use of the `USER` instruction before `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, or `ADD` instructions in a Dockerfile.  While technically not an error, using `USER` before these instructions can lead to confusion about the user context in which the file operations are performed.

## Why It Matters

-   **Clarity:** It is generally recommended to set the `WORKDIR` before changing the user with `USER`. This makes the Dockerfile easier to understand and reason about, as the context for file operations is explicit.
-   **Potential Issues:** While not always a problem, using `USER` before `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, or `ADD` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with permissions and file ownership.

## How to Fix

Place `USER` instructions after `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions. It's best practice to define the `WORKDIR` as early as possible in your Dockerfile, and then switch to a non-root user if needed.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

USER testuser
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
USER testuser
```
