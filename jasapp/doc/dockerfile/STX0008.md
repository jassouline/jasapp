# STX0008 - Delete `apt-get lists` After Installing Packages

## Description

To reduce image size and ensure efficient caching, always delete the `apt-get` lists after installing packages. This prevents unnecessary files from being included in the final image.

## Why It Matters

- Reduces image size by removing unnecessary cache files.
- Ensures better caching in multi-stage builds.
- Aligns with Dockerfile best practices for clean builds.

## Severity

- **Info**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

By adding the rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* command, you remove cached lists after installation, keeping your image lean and clean.
