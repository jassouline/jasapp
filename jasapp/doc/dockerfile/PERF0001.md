# PERF0001 - Use `-l` Flag or Low UID with `useradd`

## Description

When using the `useradd` command in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's important to either use the `-l` (or `--no-log-init`) flag or ensure that you are using a low UID. Using `useradd` to create users with high UIDs without the `-l` flag can result in excessively large Docker images.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** `useradd` without `-l` might create large files related to logging under `/var/log/` if UID is high, significantly increasing the image size.
-   **Performance:**  Smaller images lead to faster build times, faster deployments, and less storage consumption.

## How to Fix

1.  Use the `-l` flag with `useradd`:

    ```dockerfile
    RUN useradd -l -u 100000 testuser
    ```
    
    Or use the long form of the option : 
    ```dockerfile
    RUN useradd --no-log-init -u 100000 testuser
    ```

2.  Use a low UID (typically below 10000, and preferably below 1000 to avoid conflicts with system users):

    ```dockerfile
    RUN useradd -u 1000 testuser
    ```

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN useradd -u 999999 testuser
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN useradd -l -u 999999 testuser
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN useradd -u 1000 testuser
```
