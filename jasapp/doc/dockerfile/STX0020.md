# STX0020 - COPY with More Than 2 Arguments Must End with '/'

## Description

When using the `COPY` instruction with more than 2 arguments, the last argument must end with a `/`. This ensures the destination is treated as a directory.

## Why It Matters

- Without the trailing `/`, the `COPY` instruction can behave unpredictably, potentially overwriting files instead of copying them into a directory.
- Adding the `/` makes the intention explicit and prevents unintended behavior.

## Severity

- **Error**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
COPY file1.txt file2.txt /app
COPY file1.txt file2.txt /path/to/destination
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
COPY file1.txt file2.txt /app/
COPY file1.txt file2.txt /path/to/destination/
```
