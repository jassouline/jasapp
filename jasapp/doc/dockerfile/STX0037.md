# STX0037 - Use `dnf clean all` or `rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*` After `dnf install`

## Description

After installing packages with `dnf install` in a Dockerfile `RUN` instruction, it's recommended to clean the `dnf` cache to reduce the image size. This can be done by adding `dnf clean all` or `rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*` to the same `RUN` instruction after `dnf install`. The same applies to the `microdnf` command, which is a minimal version of `dnf` often used in space-constrained environments.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** The `dnf` cache can consume significant disk space. Cleaning it after installation keeps the image smaller.
-   **Reproducibility:** Ensures that each layer is minimized and doesn't include unnecessary cached files.

## How to Fix

Add `dnf clean all` or `rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*` after your `dnf install` command in the same `RUN` instruction. The same applies when using the `microdnf` command.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install -y httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install -y httpd && dnf clean all
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf install -y httpd && rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*
```
### Corrected Dockerfile with microdnf

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN microdnf install -y httpd && microdnf clean all
```
