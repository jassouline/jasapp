# STX0031 - Specify Versions with `yum install`

## Description

When using `yum install` in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's crucial to specify the version of the package you want to install. Instead of `yum install -y <package>`, use `yum install -y <package>-<version>` or `yum install -y <package_file>.rpm`.
When using `yum module install` in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's crucial to specify the version of the module you want to install. Instead of `yum module install -y <module>`, use `yum module install -y <module>:<version>`.

## Why It Matters

-   **Reproducibility:** Pinning versions ensures that your Docker builds are reproducible. Unpinned versions can lead to different package versions being installed across builds, causing inconsistencies and potential breakages if a new, incompatible version of a package is released.
-   **Stability:** By specifying a version, you guarantee that your application is built with the dependencies it has been tested with, improving stability.
-   **Security:**  Avoids unexpected installation of vulnerable versions that might be introduced in later releases.

## How to Fix

Modify your `RUN` instruction to include the desired version number after the package name, separated by a hyphen, or use a specific RPM package file.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y httpd-2.4.6
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y local-package.rpm
```
### Example with module

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum module install -y nodejs:14
```
