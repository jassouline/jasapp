# STX0006 - Avoid Using the `latest` Tag

## Description

Using the `latest` tag in `FROM` instructions is discouraged because it can lead to unpredictable behavior if the image updates. Always pin the version explicitly to ensure consistency.

## Why It Matters

- The `latest` tag points to the most recent version of an image, which may change over time.
- Changes in the `latest` tag can introduce unexpected behavior or breaking changes.
- Pinning the version ensures reproducibility and stability in your builds.

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
FROM alpine:latest
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
FROM alpine:3.14
```
