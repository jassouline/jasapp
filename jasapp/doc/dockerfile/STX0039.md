# STX0039 - Use `--no-cache-dir` with `pip install`

## Description

When using `pip install` in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's important to include the `--no-cache-dir` flag. This prevents pip from caching the downloaded packages, which can reduce the size of the Docker image.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** The pip cache can consume significant disk space. Using `--no-cache-dir` keeps the image smaller by not storing unnecessary cache data.
-   **Reproducibility:** Using `--no-cache-dir` helps ensure that each layer is minimized and doesn't include potentially large, unnecessary cached files.

## How to Fix

Add `--no-cache-dir` to your `pip install` command within the `RUN` instruction.

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR` to a truthy value (e.g., `1`, `true`, `on`, `yes`) to disable caching globally for pip commands.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

RUN pip install requests
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir requests
```

### Corrected Dockerfile (with `ENV`)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
ENV PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1

RUN pip install requests
```

## Exceptions
The rule will not trigger if you are using pip related tools such as `pipenv` or `pipx` to install packages.
## Severity

  - **Warning**
