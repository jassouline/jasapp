# SEC0029 - Create a Non-Root User with the `USER` Instruction

## Description

This rule checks if a non-root `USER` instruction is used in the Dockerfile.  It is generally considered a best practice to run containers as non-root users to enhance security.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security:** Running containers as a non-root user reduces the potential impact of a container escape vulnerability. If a container running as root is compromised, the attacker could gain root access to the host system.
-   **Least Privilege:**  Following the principle of least privilege, a container should only have the necessary permissions to perform its intended function.

## How to Fix

1.  **Create a dedicated user:** Add instructions to your Dockerfile to create a dedicated user and group for your application.
2.  **Switch to the non-root user:** Use the `USER` instruction to switch to the newly created user (or a pre-existing non-root user) before running your application.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

# No USER instruction, defaults to root
CMD ["curl", "[https://example.com](https://example.com)"]
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

# Create a group and user
RUN groupadd -r myuser && useradd -r -g myuser myuser

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files (ensure ownership is correct)
COPY --chown=myuser:myuser . /app

# Switch to the non-root user
USER myuser

CMD ["curl", "[https://example.com](https://example.com)"]
```

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

- This rule checks for the presence of a USER instruction with a non-root user. It does not validate the creation of the user or group within the Dockerfile.
- Consider using a multi-stage build to create the user in an earlier stage and then copy only the necessary artifacts to a final stage that runs as the non-root user. This can help reduce the final image size.
