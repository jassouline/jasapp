# STX0055 - Use Only One `CMD` Instruction

## Description

This rule checks for multiple `CMD` instructions in a Dockerfile. While technically not an error, having multiple `CMD` instructions is redundant as only the last `CMD` instruction will take effect when the container starts.

## Why It Matters

-   **Clarity:** Using only one `CMD` instruction makes the Dockerfile's intention clearer.
-   **Maintainability:** Avoids confusion and potential errors when modifying the Dockerfile.

## How to Fix

Consolidate multiple `CMD` instructions into a single one. If you need to execute multiple commands, use a shell script and call it from the `CMD` instruction.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

CMD ["executable", "param1"]
CMD ["executable", "param2"]
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

CMD ["executable", "param2"]
```

## Severity
