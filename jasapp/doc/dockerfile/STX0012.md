# STX0012 - Single `HEALTHCHECK` Instruction

## Description

A Dockerfile should contain only one `HEALTHCHECK` instruction. Multiple `HEALTHCHECK` instructions can cause ambiguity in how the container's health status is determined.

## Why It Matters

- Docker does not support multiple `HEALTHCHECK` instructions in a single Dockerfile.
- Using multiple `HEALTHCHECK` instructions will result in unexpected behavior during container runtime.

## Severity

- **Error**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD curl -f http://localhost || exit 1
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD curl -f http://localhost || exit 1
```

### Corrected Dockerfile
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD curl -f http://localhost || exit 1
```
