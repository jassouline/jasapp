# STX0023 - FROM Aliases Must Be Unique

## Description

In Dockerfiles, the aliases used in `FROM` instructions (i.e., stage names) must be unique.  Each alias should be used only once to name a stage.

## Why It Matters

- Using the same alias for multiple stages leads to ambiguity and can cause unexpected behavior in multi-stage builds.
- Unique aliases ensure that each stage is clearly identifiable.

## Severity

- **Error**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest AS builder
FROM ubuntu:latest AS builder
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest AS builder
FROM ubuntu:latest AS runtime
```
