# SEC0003 - Ensure `HEALTHCHECK` Instruction is Defined and Correctly Formatted

## Description

This rule verifies that a Dockerfile includes a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction and that the instruction is correctly formatted. The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction tells Docker how to test a container to ensure it is working correctly.

## Why It Matters

-   **Container Health Monitoring:** `HEALTHCHECK` allows Docker to monitor the health of running containers. This information can be used by Docker and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) to make decisions about restarting, rescheduling, or terminating unhealthy containers.
-   **Reliability:** Improves the reliability of your application by automatically detecting and reacting to unhealthy states.
-   **Observability:** Provides insights into the health of your application running inside the container.

## How to Fix

1.  **Add a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction:** Include a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in your Dockerfile if it's missing.
2.  **Use correct syntax:** Ensure the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction follows the correct syntax:
    ```
    HEALTHCHECK [OPTIONS] CMD command
    ```
    Where `[OPTIONS]` can be one or more of the following:
    -   `--interval=DURATION` (default: 30s)
    -   `--timeout=DURATION` (default: 30s)
    -   `--start-period=DURATION` (default: 0s)
    -   `--retries=N` (default: 3)
    And `command` is the command to run to check the health of the container.

**Do not use `HEALTHCHECK NONE`**, as this disables any healthcheck inherited from a base image.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule (Missing `HEALTHCHECK`)

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update
```

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule (Incorrect Syntax)

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s curl -f http://localhost/
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
```

## Severity

- **Info**

## CIS Benchmark Mapping
This rule corresponds to the following recommendation in the CIS Docker Benchmark:

CIS Docker `[version]` Benchmark v`[x.y.z]`: Ensure that HEALTHCHECK instructions have been added to container images (Automated) - [Section or Item Number] (Note: You'll need to replace `[version]`, `[x.y.z]`, and [Section or Item Number] with the appropriate values from the relevant CIS Benchmark version.)

## Other Relevant Information

- The command used in `HEALTHCHECK` should return an exit code of 0 if the container is healthy and 1 if it's unhealthy.
- The `--interval` option specifies the time between health checks.
- The `--timeout` option specifies the time after which a health check is considered to have failed.
- The `--start-period` option provides initialization time for containers that need time to bootstrap.
- The `--retries` option specifies the number of consecutive failures before the container is considered unhealthy.
- Using `HEALTHCHECK NONE` is strongly discouraged as it disables health checks, making it harder to monitor and manage the container's health.
- Refer to the official Docker documentation for more details on the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction.
