# SEC0027 - Review Use of `--trusted-host` with `pip`

## Description

This rule detects the use of the `--trusted-host` option with `pip` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile. The `--trusted-host` option disables TLS/SSL certificate verification for the specified host. While this can be necessary in some cases (e.g., with self-signed certificates in a private registry), it also poses a security risk if used incorrectly.

## Why It Matters

-   **Potential Security Risks:** Disabling certificate validation allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks if the trusted host is not properly secured or if the connection is compromised.
-   **Data Integrity:** Without certificate validation, the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded packages cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Evaluate the need for `--trusted-host`:**  Carefully consider whether `--trusted-host` is absolutely necessary. If possible, use a trusted package repository with valid certificates and remove the option.
-   **Verify the trusted host:** If you must use `--trusted-host`, double-check that the host you are trusting is legitimate and under your control.  Make sure you understand the security implications.
-   **Consider alternatives:** If you are using a self-signed certificate, consider adding the certificate to the container's trust store instead of using `--trusted-host`.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

RUN pip install --trusted-host my-internal-mirror.com requests
```

### Corrected Dockerfile (if `my-internal-mirror.com` has a valid certificate)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

RUN pip install requests
```

### Corrected Dockerfile (if `my-internal-mirror.com` uses a self-signed certificate)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

COPY my-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
RUN update-ca-certificates

RUN pip install requests
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `pip` with the `--trusted-host` option.
-   The rule flags the use of `--trusted-host` as a warning, as there might be legitimate (but carefully considered) use cases.
-   Always ensure that you are downloading packages from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified.
