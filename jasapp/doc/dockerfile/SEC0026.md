# SEC0026 - Avoid Configuring `yum` to Disable SSL Verification

## Description

This rule detects the modification of `yum` configuration within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that disables SSL verification. Specifically, it checks for the presence of `sslverify=false` in commands that use `yum`.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Disabling SSL verification when using `yum` can allow Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept the connection to the package repository and provide malicious packages instead of the intended ones.
-   **Data Integrity:** Without SSL verification, the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded packages cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Enable SSL verification:** Ensure that `sslverify=true` (or remove the `sslverify` setting altogether, as `true` is the default) is set in your `yum` configuration.
-   **Use trusted repositories:** Ensure that you are using trusted and verified package repositories with properly configured SSL certificates.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y --setopt=sslverify=false httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y httpd
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the `yum` package manager and its `sslverify` configuration option.
-   Always ensure that you are downloading packages from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified using SSL.
