# STX0049 - Ensure Specific Label Values are Potentially Valid SPDX License Identifiers

## Description

This rule checks if the values of specific labels in `LABEL` instructions within a Dockerfile are potentially valid SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) license identifiers. You can configure the list of labels that require SPDX license validation when creating an instance of this rule.

**Note:** This rule performs a basic format check and does not guarantee that the identifier exists in the official SPDX license list. It only verifies that the format is compatible with common SPDX identifiers.

## Why It Matters

-   **License Compliance:**  Using a standard identifier format helps ensure that the image properly declares its license, although it does not replace a full SPDX validation.
-   **Data Integrity:** Ensures that labels intended to hold license information follow a common format, preventing basic errors.

## How to Fix

Ensure that the values assigned to the specified labels follow a basic SPDX identifier format : Alphanumeric characters, dashes, dots and plus signs are allowed.

## Example

Assuming the SPDX label is `license`:

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

LABEL license="My Custom License"
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

LABEL license="MIT"
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Configuration

This rule is configurable. When creating an instance of `STX0049`, you can pass a list of label names that require SPDX license identifier validation:

```python
spdx_labels = ["license", "licence"]  # Use British English spelling as well
rule_instance = STX0049(spdx_labels=spdx_labels)
```
