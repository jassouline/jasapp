# STX0030 - Use `yum clean all` After `yum install`

## Description

After installing packages with `yum install` in a Dockerfile `RUN` instruction, it's recommended to clean the `yum` cache to reduce the image size. This can be done by adding `yum clean all` or `rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*` to the same `RUN` instruction after `yum install`.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** The `yum` cache can consume significant disk space. Cleaning it after installation keeps the image smaller.
-   **Reproducibility:**  Ensures that each layer is minimized and doesn't include unnecessary cached files.

## How to Fix

Add `yum clean all` or `rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*` after your `yum install` command in the same `RUN` instruction.

## Severity

- **Warning**


## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y httpd && yum clean all
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y httpd && rm -rf /var/cache/yum/*
```
