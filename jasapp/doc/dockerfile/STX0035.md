# STX0035 - Specify Versions with `zypper install` and `zypper in`

## Description

When using `zypper install` or `zypper in` in `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile, it's crucial to specify the version of the package you want to install. Instead of `zypper install -y <package>` or `zypper in -y <package>`, use `zypper install -y <package>=<version>` or `zypper in -y <package>=<version>` or `zypper install -y <package>.rpm` or `zypper in -y <package>.rpm`.

## Why It Matters

-   **Reproducibility:** Pinning versions ensures that your Docker builds are reproducible. Unpinned versions can lead to different package versions being installed across builds, causing inconsistencies and potential breakages if a new, incompatible version of a package is released.
-   **Stability:** By specifying a version, you guarantee that your application is built with the dependencies it has been tested with, improving stability.
-   **Security:** Avoids unexpected installation of vulnerable versions that might be introduced in later releases.

## How to Fix

Modify your `RUN` instruction to include the desired version number after the package name, separated by an equals sign, or use a specific RPM package file.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper install -y httpd
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper install -y httpd=2.4.33
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.3

RUN zypper install -y local-package.rpm
```
