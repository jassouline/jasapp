# STX0044 - Ensure Required Labels Are Defined in Each Stage

## Description

This rule checks if specific, required labels are defined in each stage of a Dockerfile. You can configure the list of required labels when creating an instance of this rule.

## Why It Matters

-   **Metadata Consistency:**  Ensures that essential metadata is consistently applied across all stages of a build, improving clarity and maintainability.
-   **Compliance:** Helps enforce organizational policies or standards that mandate specific labels for all images.
-   **Automation:** Facilitates automation tasks that rely on the presence of certain labels.

## How to Fix

Ensure that all required labels are defined using the `LABEL` instruction within each stage (`FROM` instruction) of your Dockerfile.

## Example

Assuming the required labels are `maintainer` and `version`:

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
LABEL maintainer="test"

FROM alpine:latest AS builder
LABEL version="1.0"
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
LABEL maintainer="test"
LABEL version="1.0"

FROM alpine:latest AS builder
LABEL maintainer="test"
LABEL version="1.0"
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Configuration

This rule is configurable. When creating an instance of `STX0044`, pass a list of required label names:

```python
required_labels = ["maintainer", "version", "project_name"]
rule_instance = STX0044(required_labels=required_labels)
```
