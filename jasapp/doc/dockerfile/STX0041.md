# STX0041 - Do Not Refer to an Environment Variable Within the Same `ENV` Statement Where It Is Defined

## Description

In a Dockerfile, you should not reference an environment variable within the same `ENV` instruction where it is defined. This is because the variable's value is not yet set when it's being referenced.

## Why It Matters

-   **Undefined Behavior:** Referencing a variable that hasn't been fully defined can lead to unexpected values or errors during the build process.
-   **Clarity:** It's best practice to define variables before using them to improve readability and maintainability of the Dockerfile.

## How to Fix

Define the environment variable in a separate `ENV` instruction before referencing it in another `ENV` instruction.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
ENV MY_VAR=hello \
    MY_VAR=$MY_VAR
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
ENV MY_VAR=hello
ENV OTHER_VAR=$MY_VAR
```

## Severity

  - **Error**
