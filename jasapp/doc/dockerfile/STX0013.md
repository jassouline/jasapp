# STX0013 - Pin Versions in `pip install`

## Description

When using `pip install` in Dockerfiles, it's recommended to pin the version of each package. This prevents unexpected updates from breaking your build.

## Why It Matters

- **Consistency**: Ensures the exact same version of a package is used across builds.
- **Stability**: Prevents unexpected issues caused by newer package versions.
- **Best Practices**: Encourages reproducible builds.

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN pip install flask requests
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
RUN pip install flask==2.0.1 requests==2.25.1
```

Alternatively, use a requirements file:

```dockerfile
RUN pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```
