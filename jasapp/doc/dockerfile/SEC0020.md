# SEC0020 - Avoid Configuring `yum` to Skip GPG Signature Checks

## Description

This rule detects the use of `yum` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that skip GPG signature checks for packages. Specifically, it checks for the presence of the `--nogpgcheck` flag or the `gpgcheck=0` option.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Skipping GPG signature checks can lead to the installation of tampered or malicious packages. GPG signatures are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of packages.
-   **Compromised Packages:** If you skip GPG checks, you might unknowingly install packages that have been modified by an attacker, potentially compromising the security of your container.

## How to Fix

-   **Enable GPG checks:** Remove the `--nogpgcheck` flag and ensure that `gpgcheck=1` is set in your `yum` configuration (this is usually the default).
-   **Verify package sources:** Ensure that you are using trusted and verified package repositories.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install --nogpgcheck httpd
RUN yum install httpd -y --setopt=gpgcheck=0
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y httpd
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `yum` with options that disable GPG signature checks.
-   Always ensure that you are installing packages from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified using GPG signatures.
