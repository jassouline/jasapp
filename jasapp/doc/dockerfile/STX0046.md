# STX0046 - Ensure Required Labels Are Not Empty

## Description

This rule checks if specific, required labels in `LABEL` instructions within a Dockerfile have non-empty values. You can configure the list of required labels when creating an instance of this rule.

## Why It Matters

-   **Metadata Integrity:** Ensures that essential metadata is actually populated with meaningful values, improving the usefulness of labels for informational and automation purposes.
-   **Compliance:** Helps enforce organizational policies or standards that mandate specific labels to have content.

## How to Fix

Ensure that all required labels are defined with non-empty values using the `LABEL` instruction within your Dockerfile.

## Example

Assuming the required labels are `maintainer` and `version`:

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

LABEL maintainer="" version="1.0"
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

LABEL maintainer="test" version="1.0"
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Configuration

This rule is configurable. When creating an instance of `STX0046`, you can pass a list of required label names:

```python
required_labels = ["maintainer", "version", "project_name"]
rule_instance = STX0046(required_labels=required_labels)
```
