# SEC0024 - Avoid Disabling Strict SSL in `npm` Configuration

## Description

This rule detects the use of `npm config set strict-ssl false` within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile. Disabling strict SSL in `npm` configuration can pose a security risk as it allows the installation of packages without verifying the authenticity of the npm registry using SSL certificates.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Disabling strict SSL can allow Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could potentially intercept the connection to the npm registry and inject malicious code into the packages being installed.
-   **Package Integrity:** Without strict SSL, the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded packages cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Enable strict SSL:** Ensure that `npm`'s `strict-ssl` configuration is set to `true` (which is the default). Remove any `npm config set strict-ssl false` commands from your Dockerfile.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

RUN npm config set strict-ssl false
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

# strict-ssl is enabled by default in npm, no need to set it explicitly
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the `npm config set strict-ssl false` command.
-   Always ensure that you are downloading packages from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified.
-   Consider using a private npm registry with properly configured SSL certificates for enhanced security.
