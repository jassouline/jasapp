# STX0007 - Pin Versions in `apt-get install`

## Description

When using `apt-get install` in Dockerfiles, it's recommended to pin the version of each package to prevent future updates from breaking your build. This ensures consistency and reproducibility.

## Why It Matters

- Unpinned versions can lead to builds failing unexpectedly if the latest version of a package introduces breaking changes.
- Pinning versions ensures that the exact version of a package is used, providing a predictable and stable build environment.

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install curl vim
```

### Corrected Dockerfile
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install curl=7.68.0 vim=8.2.2434-1
```
