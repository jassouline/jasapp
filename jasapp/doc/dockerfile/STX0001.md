# STX0001 - Ensure WORKDIR Instruction Uses an Absolute Path

## Description

This rule checks if the `WORKDIR` instruction in a Dockerfile uses an absolute path. Using absolute paths for the working directory improves image portability and maintainability.

## Why It Matters

- **Portability:** Relative paths within a Dockerfile can lead to unexpected behavior when the image is built or run in different contexts. Using absolute paths ensures consistent behavior regardless of the build environment.
- **Maintainability:** Absolute paths are easier to understand and modify, reducing the risk of errors and improving code readability.

## How to Fix

Modify the `WORKDIR` instruction to use an absolute path. 

* **For Unix systems:** Start the path with a forward slash (e.g., `/app`, `/usr/local/bin`).
* **For Windows systems:** Use the format `C:\path\to\directory`.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

WORKDIR app
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

WORKDIR /app
```

## Severity

  - **Error** 

*Note: This rule does not currently handle cases where the WORKDIR argument is an environment variable.*
