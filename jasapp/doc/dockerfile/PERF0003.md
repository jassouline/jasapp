# PERF0003 - Ensure `HEALTHCHECK` Instruction is Present

## Description

This rule checks for the presence of the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in a Dockerfile. The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working.

## Why It Matters

-   **Container Health Monitoring:** `HEALTHCHECK` allows Docker to monitor the health of running containers and restart them if they become unhealthy.
-   **Reliability:** Improves the reliability of your application by automatically detecting and recovering from failures.
-   **Orchestration:**  Container orchestrators like Kubernetes can use health checks to make scheduling and scaling decisions.

## How to Fix

Add a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction to your Dockerfile. The instruction should specify a command that checks the health of your application.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update

HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
```

## Severity

  - **Ignore** (Note: Hadolint uses "ignore" severity for this rule, which we are mapping to "ignore" here. You might consider it a "warning" or "info" depending on your project's requirements.)
