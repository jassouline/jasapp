# STX0025 - Use Only Allowed Registries in FROM

## Description

The `FROM` instruction in Dockerfiles should only use images from allowed registries. This rule allows you to specify a set of permitted registries.

## Why It Matters

- Using images from untrusted or unknown registries can introduce security vulnerabilities.
- Restricting the allowed registries helps ensure that only approved base images are used.

## Severity

- **Error**

## Configuration

This rule accepts a set of allowed registries through the constructor. It can be configured in the following ways:

-   No allowed registries specified: All registries are allowed (default).
-   Empty set: Only `docker.io` and `hub.docker.com` are allowed.
-   Set to  `docker.io` and `hub.docker.com` : Only images from those registries are allowed.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule (with allowed registries set to `docker.io` and `hub.docker.com`)

```dockerfile
FROM otherregistry.com/myimage:latest
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
```

Or using an explicit Docker Hub images :

```dockerfile
FROM docker.io/alpine:latest
```

Or, using explicit hub.docker.com :

```dockerfile
FROM hub.docker.com/alpine:latest
```

Or, using scratch :

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
```
