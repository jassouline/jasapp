# STX0011 - Valid UNIX Ports

## Description

This rule ensures that all ports exposed in a Dockerfile are within the valid UNIX port range (0 to 65535). Ports outside this range are not usable by standard network stacks and can cause runtime issues.

## Why It Matters

- Ports above 65535 are invalid and cannot be used by applications
- Ensuring valid port ranges prevents runtime errors and misconfigurations.

## Severity

- **Error**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 70000
EXPOSE 5000-70000
```

### Corrected Dockerfile
```dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 5000-6000
```
