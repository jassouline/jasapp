# PERF0005 - Use Either `wget` or `curl`, Not Both

## Description

This rule checks for the presence of both `wget` and `curl` within the same `RUN` instruction in a Dockerfile. While both tools can be used to download files, using only one can potentially reduce the image size.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:**  Including both `wget` and `curl` in the same `RUN` instruction might add unnecessary bloat to your image if only one is needed.
-   **Simplicity:** Using a single tool for a specific task simplifies the Dockerfile and makes it easier to understand.

## How to Fix

Choose either `wget` or `curl` for downloading files within a single `RUN` instruction, depending on your specific needs and preferences. Remove the unnecessary tool.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN wget [invalid URL removed] && curl -O [invalid URL removed]
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN wget [invalid URL removed] && wget [invalid URL removed]
```

Or

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN curl -O [invalid URL removed] && curl -O [invalid URL removed]
```
