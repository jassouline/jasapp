# SEC0022 - Avoid Using `apt-get install` without `-y` or with `--force-yes` or `--allow-unauthenticated`

## Description

This rule detects the use of `apt-get install` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that either lack the `-y` flag or use the `--force-yes` or `--allow-unauthenticated` options. Using `apt-get install` without `-y` can cause the build to hang, waiting for user input. Using `--force-yes` or `--allow-unauthenticated` can bypass important security checks and lead to the installation of compromised or unverified packages.

## Why It Matters

-   **Automation:** Docker builds should be fully automated. `apt-get install` without `-y` can halt the build process, requiring manual intervention.
-   **Security Risks:** Forcing installation with `--force-yes` can overwrite existing files and configurations without warning, potentially leading to system instability or security vulnerabilities. Using `--allow-unauthenticated` bypasses package signature verification, increasing the risk of installing malicious or tampered software.
-   **Reproducibility:**  Builds should be consistent and predictable. Manual intervention or bypassing security checks can introduce variability.

## How to Fix

-   **Use `-y`:** Always use the `-y` flag with `apt-get install` to automatically answer "yes" to all prompts.
-   **Avoid `--force-yes`:** Remove the `--force-yes` option unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason for using it.
-   **Avoid `--allow-unauthenticated`:** Remove the `--allow-unauthenticated` option and ensure that all installed packages are from trusted, signed repositories.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get install curl
RUN apt-get install --force-yes curl
RUN apt-get install --allow-unauthenticated curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `apt-get install` without `-y` and with dangerous options.
-   Always ensure you understand the implications of using these options before bypassing default security mechanisms.
