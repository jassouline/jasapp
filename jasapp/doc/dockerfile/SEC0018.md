# SEC0018 - Avoid Configuring `apk` to Allow Untrusted Repositories

## Description

This rule detects the use of `apk` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that allow the installation of packages from untrusted repositories. Specifically, it checks for the presence of the `--allow-untrusted` flag without the corresponding `--no-allow-untrusted` flag.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Allowing untrusted repositories can lead to the installation of malicious or compromised packages, potentially compromising the security of the container and the host system.
-   **Package Integrity:**  Packages from untrusted repositories may not have undergone the same level of scrutiny and quality control as those from official or trusted repositories.

## How to Fix

-   **Use trusted repositories:** Ensure that you are only using trusted and verified repositories for installing packages with `apk`.
-   **Explicitly deny untrusted:** Use the `--no-allow-untrusted` flag with `apk` commands to explicitly forbid the installation of packages from untrusted repositories.
-   **Remove `--allow-untrusted`:** If `--allow-untrusted` is present, remove it unless absolutely necessary and you understand the associated risks.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --allow-untrusted curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --no-allow-untrusted curl
```

Or, if you are sure that you are using trusted repositories:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add curl
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the `apk` package manager and its `--allow-untrusted` and `--no-allow-untrusted` flags.
-   Always ensure that you are using trusted repositories and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified.
