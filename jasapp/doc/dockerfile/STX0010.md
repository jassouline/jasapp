# Rule: Use `ADD` for Extracting Archives into an Image (STX0010)

**Hadolint Reference**: `DL3010`

## Description

This rule enforces the use of the `ADD` instruction instead of `COPY` followed by an extraction command (e.g., `tar`, `unzip`) in the `RUN` instruction. Using `ADD` directly simplifies the Dockerfile and improves build efficiency.

## Why It Matters

- `ADD` can directly extract archives into the image, avoiding additional commands for extraction.
- This reduces the number of layers in the image and enhances readability.

## Example of a Dockerfile That Violates This Rule

```dockerfile
COPY archive.tar /app
RUN cd /app && tar -xvf archive.tar
```

## Example of a Dockerfile That Violates This Rule

```dockerfile
ADD archive.tar /app
```

## Severity

**Info**: The rule provides informative guidance for improving Dockerfile efficiency and readability.
