# STX0016 - Pin Versions in `npm install`

## Description

When using `npm install` in Dockerfiles, it is recommended to pin the versions of all packages. This ensures consistency and reproducibility of your builds.

## Why It Matters

- Unpinned versions can lead to unexpected build failures if the latest version of a package introduces breaking changes.
- Pinning versions ensures that the same version of a package is installed every time the image is built.

## Severity

- **Warning**

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN npm install express react
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
RUN npm install express@4.17.1 react@16.13.1
```

### Alternative Correct Usage

```dockerfile
RUN npm install git+https://github.com/user/repo#commit
RUN npm install ./local-package
RUN npm install ~/my-package.tgz
```
