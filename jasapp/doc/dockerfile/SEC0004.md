# SEC0004 - Do Not Use `update` Instructions Alone

## Description

This rule checks for `RUN` instructions that contain only a package manager update command (e.g., `apt-get update`, `yum update`, `apk update`) without any subsequent package installation commands.

## Why It Matters

-   **Layer Caching:** Docker caches the results of each instruction. If an `update` command is used alone in a `RUN` instruction, that layer will be cached. When you later add an `install` command in a subsequent `RUN` instruction, the `update` layer might be outdated, leading to the installation of older packages.
-   **Reproducibility:**  Using `update` alone can lead to non-reproducible builds, as the updated packages can vary between builds depending on the state of the package repositories at the time of the build.

## How to Fix

Combine `update` and `install` commands in a single `RUN` instruction. This ensures that the package list is updated immediately before the packages are installed, avoiding caching issues.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## CIS Benchmark Mapping

This rule corresponds to the following recommendation in the CIS Docker Benchmark:

-   **CIS Docker [version] Benchmark v[x.y.z]:**  Do not use `update` instructions alone in the Dockerfile (Automated) - **[Section or Item Number]** (Note: You'll need to replace `[version]`, `[x.y.z]`, and `[Section or Item Number]` with the appropriate values from the relevant CIS Benchmark version.)

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule currently recognizes the following package manager update commands: `apt-get update`, `yum update`, `yum upgrade`, `apk update`, `pacman -Syu`, `zypper update`, `dnf update` and `dnf upgrade`.
-   It allows the use of options with these commands (e.g., `apt-get update -y`).
