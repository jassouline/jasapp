# STX0052 - Use `yarn cache clean` After `yarn install`

## Description

This rule checks if `yarn cache clean` is used in a `RUN` instruction after `yarn install` within the same Dockerfile. Cleaning the yarn cache after installation helps reduce the size of the Docker image.

## Why It Matters

-   **Image Size:** The yarn cache can consume significant disk space. Cleaning it after installation with `yarn install` keeps the image smaller.
-   **Reproducibility:** Ensures that each layer is minimized and doesn't include unnecessary cached files.

## How to Fix

Add `yarn cache clean` after your `yarn install` command in the same `RUN` instruction.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

RUN yarn install
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

RUN yarn install && yarn cache clean
```
