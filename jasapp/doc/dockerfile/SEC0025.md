# SEC0025 - Avoid Configuring `git` to Disable SSL Verification

## Description

This rule detects the use of `git config` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that disable SSL verification. Specifically, it checks for `git config` commands that set `http.sslVerify` to `false`.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Disabling SSL verification for `git` can allow Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept the connection to the `git` repository and provide malicious code or modified files.
-   **Data Integrity:** Without SSL verification, the authenticity and integrity of the cloned repository and its history cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Enable SSL verification:** Ensure that `http.sslVerify` is set to `true` in your `git` configuration (this is usually the default). Remove any `git config --global http.sslVerify false` commands from your Dockerfile.
-   **Use HTTPS:** Use HTTPS URLs for your `git` repositories to enable secure communication.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN git config --global http.sslVerify false && git clone [invalid URL removed]
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN git clone [invalid URL removed]
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `git config` to disable SSL verification.
-   Always ensure that you are interacting with trusted `git` repositories over secure connections (HTTPS).
