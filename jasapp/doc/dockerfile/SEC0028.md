# SEC0028 - Do Not Expose Port 22

## Description

This rule checks for the use of the `EXPOSE` instruction exposing port 22 in a Dockerfile. Exposing port 22, which is commonly used for SSH, can increase the attack surface of the container.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Exposing port 22 can make your container a target for SSH brute-force attacks if not properly secured.
-   **Best Practices:** It is generally recommended to avoid exposing unnecessary ports, and SSH access should be carefully managed and not exposed directly unless required.

## How to Fix

-   **Avoid exposing port 22:** Remove the `EXPOSE 22` instruction if SSH access is not needed from outside the container.
-   **Use alternative methods for access:** If you need to access the container for debugging or maintenance, consider using `docker exec` instead of exposing the SSH port.
-   **Secure SSH:** If you must expose port 22, ensure that SSH is properly configured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication) and consider using a non-standard port.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

EXPOSE 22 80
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

EXPOSE 80
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule only flags the `EXPOSE` instruction. It does not check if port 22 is actually mapped to a host port when running the container.
-   Consider the specific needs of your application and environment when deciding whether or not to expose port 22.
-   Always follow security best practices when configuring SSH access.
