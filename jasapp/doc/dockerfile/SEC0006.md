# SEC0006 - Avoid Hardcoded Secrets in `ENV`, `ARG`, or `RUN`

## Description

This rule detects the presence of hardcoded secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys, tokens) in `ENV`, `ARG`, or `RUN` instructions within a Dockerfile.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Hardcoding secrets directly in the Dockerfile is a major security vulnerability. Anyone with access to the image or the Dockerfile can view these secrets.
-   **Compromised Credentials:** If the image is pushed to a public registry or the Dockerfile is shared publicly, the secrets will be exposed to the world.
-   **Best Practices:**  Secrets should be managed securely using dedicated secret management tools or environment variables passed at runtime.

## How to Fix

-   **Use Docker Secrets (for Docker Swarm):** If you are using Docker Swarm, you can leverage Docker Secrets to manage sensitive data.
-   **Use Buildkit secrets (for Docker build):** If you are using Docker build, you can use Buildkit secrets to manage sensitive data.
-   **Use a secrets management tool:** Use a dedicated secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve secrets.
-   **Pass secrets as build-time arguments (with caution):** You can pass secrets as build-time arguments using `ARG` and `--build-arg`, but be very careful not to persist them in the image (e.g., do not copy them into the image or use them in `ENV` instructions that persist).
-   **Use environment variables at runtime:** Inject secrets as environment variables when running the container (e.g., using `docker run -e MY_SECRET=$MY_SECRET`).

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

ENV API_KEY=your_secret_api_key
ARG PASSWORD=secret_password
RUN echo "DATABASE_TOKEN=your_database_token" >> config.txt
```

### Corrected Dockerfile (using build-time arguments cautiously)

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

ARG API_KEY
ARG PASSWORD
RUN echo "DATABASE_TOKEN=$DATABASE_TOKEN" >> config.txt

# ... later, use the variables but do not persist them in the image ...
```

**Build command:**

```bash
docker build --build-arg API_KEY=$API_KEY --build-arg PASSWORD=$PASSWORD .
```

**Note:** This is a simplified example. It's strongly recommended to use a dedicated secrets management solution for production environments.

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule uses regular expressions to detect potential secrets. You can customize the `secret_patterns` list in the `SEC0006` class to add or modify patterns to match your specific needs.
-   Be very careful when using build-time arguments for secrets. Avoid persisting them in the image.
-   Consider using multi-stage builds to further minimize the risk of exposing secrets.
-   Always refer to the best practices for managing secrets in your specific environment and with your chosen orchestration tools.
