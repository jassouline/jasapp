# STX0064 - Avoid `RUN` After `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`

## Description

This rule detects the presence of `RUN` instructions after `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instructions within a Dockerfile. While technically not an error, placing `RUN` instructions after `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` is generally not recommended and can lead to confusion.

## Why It Matters

-   **Build-time vs. Run-time:** `RUN` instructions are executed during the image build process, while `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` define commands to be executed when the container starts. Placing `RUN` after `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` can blur the lines between these two phases.
-   **Clarity:**  It is generally considered best practice to define all build steps (using `RUN`) before defining the container's runtime behavior with `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`. This improves the readability and maintainability of the Dockerfile.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Although Docker will not throw an error, placing `RUN` after `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` might not have the intended effect, as the image will be built with those instructions executed in that specific order, potentially leading to an unexpected final image state.

## How to Fix

Place all `RUN` instructions before the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` instructions in your Dockerfile.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

CMD ["echo", "Hello from CMD"]

RUN echo "This will execute during build, but after CMD"
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN echo "This will execute during build, before CMD"

CMD ["echo", "Hello from CMD"]
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**
