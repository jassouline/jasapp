# SEC0011 - Avoid Insecure `chmod` Permissions in `RUN`

## Description

This rule detects the use of `chmod` commands in `RUN` instructions that set insecure file permissions within a Dockerfile.  Specifically, it flags permissions that grant write or execute access to 'group' or 'other' (e.g., `777`, `766`, `666`, `a+rwx`, `u+rwx`, etc.)

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Granting excessive permissions to files or directories inside a container can make it vulnerable to attacks. If a process inside the container is compromised, an attacker might be able to modify files they shouldn't have access to, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other security breaches.

## How to Fix

-   **Use least privilege principle:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to files and directories.
-   **Avoid world-writable permissions:**  Never use `777` or `666` permissions.
-   **Use specific permissions:** Use specific permission sets like `755` for executables and `644` for data files when possible.
-   **Review group and other permissions:** Carefully consider whether group or other users need write or execute access to files within the container.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN chmod 777 /app/my_script.sh
RUN chmod 666 /app/my_data.txt
RUN chmod u+rwx /app/my_script.sh
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN chmod 755 /app/my_script.sh
RUN chmod 644 /app/my_data.txt
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**
