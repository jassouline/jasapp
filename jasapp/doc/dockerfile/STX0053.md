# STX0053 - Ensure Valid Instruction Order at the Start of a Dockerfile

## Description

This rule checks that a Dockerfile begins with a `FROM` instruction, an `ARG` instruction, a comment (`#`), or a parser directive (`# syntax` or `# escape`). Any other instruction appearing before these will trigger an error. Additionally, it ensures that any instruction coming after a valid instruction that is not `FROM`, `ARG`, a comment, or a parser directive will be flagged.

## Why It Matters

-   **Dockerfile Standards:** Dockerfiles have a specific structure that should be followed for clarity and to ensure proper parsing by Docker.
-   **Build Failures:** An invalid instruction order can cause the Docker build to fail.

## How to Fix

Ensure that your Dockerfile starts with one of the following:

-   `FROM` instruction (most common)
-   `ARG` instruction
-   Comment (`#`)
-   Parser directive (`# syntax` or `# escape`)

Place any other instructions after the initial `FROM`, `ARG`, comments, or parser directives.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
RUN echo "hello"  # Invalid: RUN should not be the first instruction
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN echo "hello"
```

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION=latest
FROM ubuntu:$VERSION
```

```dockerfile
# This is a comment
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

## Severity

  - **Error**
