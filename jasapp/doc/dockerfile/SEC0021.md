# SEC0021 - Avoid Configuring `rpm` to Skip Package Signature Checks

## Description

This rule detects the use of `rpm` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile that skip package signature checks. Specifically, it checks for the presence of the `--nosignature` flag.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Skipping signature checks can lead to the installation of tampered or malicious packages. Package signatures are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of packages.
-   **Compromised Packages:** If you skip signature checks, you might unknowingly install packages that have been modified by an attacker, potentially compromising the security of your container.

## How to Fix

-   **Enable signature checks:** Remove the `--nosignature` flag from the `rpm` command.
-   **Verify package sources:** Ensure that you are using trusted and verified package repositories.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN rpm -i --nosignature package.rpm
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

RUN rpm -i package.rpm
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `rpm` with the `--nosignature` option.
-   Always ensure that you are installing packages from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified using signature checks.
