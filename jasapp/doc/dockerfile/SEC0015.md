# SEC0015 - Avoid Using `--trusted-host` with `pip`

## Description

This rule detects the use of the `--trusted-host` option with `pip` commands within `RUN` instructions in a Dockerfile. The `--trusted-host` option disables TLS/SSL certificate verification for the specified host, which can pose a security risk.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Disabling certificate validation allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept the connection and provide malicious packages instead of the intended ones.
-   **Data Integrity:** Without certificate validation, the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded packages cannot be guaranteed.

## How to Fix

-   **Avoid using `--trusted-host`:**  If possible, remove the `--trusted-host` option and rely on proper certificate validation.
-   **Use a trusted package repository:** Ensure that you are using a trusted package repository with valid certificates.
-   **Add trusted certificates:** If you must use `--trusted-host`, make absolutely sure you understand the risks and have properly configured the trusted host.  Consider adding the necessary certificates to the container's trust store instead.

## Example

### Dockerfile Triggering the Rule

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.org requests
```

### Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN pip install requests
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically targets the use of `pip` with the `--trusted-host` option.
-   Always ensure that you are downloading packages from trusted sources and that the integrity of the downloaded packages is verified.
