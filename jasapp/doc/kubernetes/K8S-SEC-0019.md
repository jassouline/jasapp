# K8S-SEC-0019 - Avoid Deploying the Kubernetes Dashboard

## Description

This rule detects the deployment of the Kubernetes dashboard in a Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes dashboard is a web-based user interface that allows you to manage your cluster.  While it can be useful, it can also be a security risk if not properly secured.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** If the Kubernetes dashboard is exposed to the internet or accessible to unauthorized users, it can be exploited by attackers to gain control of your cluster.
-   **Attack Vector:** The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to manage the cluster, which can be an attractive target for attackers.
-   **Best Practices:**  It's generally recommended to disable or restrict access to the Kubernetes dashboard in production environments, especially if it's not strictly necessary.

## How to Fix

-   **Disable the dashboard:** If the dashboard is not needed, do not deploy it or remove it if it's already deployed.
-   **Restrict access:** If you need to use the dashboard, restrict access to authorized users only using strong authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)).
-   **Avoid public exposure:** Do not expose the dashboard to the public internet.
-   **Use alternative management tools:** Consider using command-line tools like `kubectl` or other secure management interfaces for managing your cluster.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-dashboard-pod
  labels:
    app: kubernetes-dashboard
spec:
  containers:
  - name: dashboard-container
    image: kubernetesui/dashboard
```

### Corrected Manifest

(Remove the Kubernetes dashboard deployment entirely if it's not needed.)

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule detects the presence of Pods that are likely to be part of a Kubernetes dashboard deployment, based on common labels (`app: kubernetes-dashboard`, `k8s-app: kubernetes-dashboard`) and image names (`kubernetes-dashboard`, `kubernetesui`).
-   The Kubernetes dashboard is often deployed as an add-on and may not be present in all clusters.
-   If you need to use the dashboard, ensure it is properly secured and its access is restricted.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [securing the Kubernetes dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/).
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).
