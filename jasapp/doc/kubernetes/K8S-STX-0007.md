# K8S-STX-0007 - Configure Readiness Probes for Containers

## Description

This rule checks if Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets have readiness probes configured for their containers. Readiness probes are used by the kubelet to determine when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.

## Why It Matters

-   **Service Availability:** Readiness probes ensure that a container is fully initialized and ready to handle requests before it starts receiving traffic. This prevents sending traffic to a container that is not yet ready, improving service availability.
-   **Rolling Updates:** During rolling updates, readiness probes are used to determine when a new Pod is ready to serve traffic. This helps ensure zero-downtime deployments.
-   **Load Balancing:** Readiness probes help load balancers make informed decisions about routing traffic to healthy and ready instances of your application.

## How to Fix

Add a `readinessProbe` field to your container specifications. The readiness probe defines a command, HTTP request, or TCP socket check that is periodically executed to determine if the container is ready to receive traffic.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of the `readinessProbe` field within container specifications.
-   There are three types of readiness probes:
    -   **`exec`:** Executes a command inside the container.
    -   **`httpGet`:** Performs an HTTP GET request against the container's IP address.
    -   **`tcpSocket`:** Attempts to open a TCP socket to a specific port on the container.
-   You can configure various parameters for readiness probes, such as `initialDelaySeconds`, `periodSeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, `successThreshold`, and `failureThreshold`.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).
