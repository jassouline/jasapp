# K8S-SEC-0023 - Avoid Implicit Service Account Token Mounting

## Description

This rule detects if Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, or ReplicaSets are implicitly mounting service account tokens. By default, Kubernetes automatically mounts a service account token into each container, which can be a security risk if the container does not require access to the Kubernetes API.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** If a container is compromised, the service account token could be used by an attacker to interact with the Kubernetes API, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.
-   **Least Privilege:** Containers should only have access to the resources they need. Mounting a service account token when it's not required violates the principle of least privilege.

## How to Fix

-   **Explicitly disable token mounting:** Set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` in the Pod specification (or in the Pod template for other resource types) to prevent the automatic mounting of service account tokens.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the absence of `automountServiceAccountToken: false` in the Pod specification or the Pod template specification.
-   If `automountServiceAccountToken` is not explicitly set to `false`, Kubernetes will automatically mount a service account token into each container.
-   Consider the security implications before allowing a container to access the Kubernetes API via a service account token.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [service accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) and [security best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/security-best-practices/).
