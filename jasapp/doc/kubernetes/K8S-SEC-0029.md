# K8S-SEC-0029 - Ensure Tiller (Helm V2) Service is Deleted

## Description

This rule detects if the Tiller service, associated with Helm v2, is present in the Kubernetes cluster. Tiller, the server-side component of Helm v2, has known security risks due to its broad permissions, and it has been removed in Helm v3.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Tiller typically requires extensive permissions in the cluster to function, making it a high-value target for attackers. If compromised, Tiller could be used to gain control of the entire cluster.
-   **Deprecation:** Tiller is deprecated in Helm v3 and is no longer necessary.
-   **Least Privilege:** Using Helm v3 without Tiller allows for a more granular and secure approach to managing Helm charts.

## How to Fix

1.  **Upgrade to Helm v3:** The recommended solution is to migrate to Helm v3, which does not use Tiller.
2.  **Delete the Tiller service (if using Helm v2):** If you must continue using Helm v2, delete the Tiller service after ensuring no other components depend on it. You can typically do this with:
    ```bash
    kubectl -n kube-system delete service tiller-deploy
    ```

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: tiller-deploy
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    app: helm
    name: tiller
spec:
  ports:
  - name: tiller
    port: 44134
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: tiller
  selector:
    app: helm
    name: tiller
  type: ClusterIP
```

### Corrected Action

Upgrade to Helm v3 and remove any Tiller-related resources, including the `tiller-deploy` service.

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule specifically checks for the presence of a Kubernetes `Service` resource with the name `tiller-deploy`.
-   Helm v3 offers significant improvements in security and architecture compared to Helm v2.
-   Refer to the Helm documentation for more information on [migrating from Helm v2 to Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/).
