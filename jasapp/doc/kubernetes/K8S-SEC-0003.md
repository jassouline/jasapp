# K8S-SEC-0003 - Prevent Sharing the Host's PID Namespace

## Description

This rule detects if Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, or ReplicaSets are configured to share the host's process ID namespace. Sharing the host's PID namespace allows processes within the container to see all processes on the host system, potentially exposing sensitive information.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Sharing the host's PID namespace breaks the isolation between containers and the host. A compromised container could gain access to information about processes running on the host system or in other containers.
-   **Information Disclosure:** Processes in a container can access the `/proc` directory of the host, which may include sensitive information like passwords or keys passed as environment variables.

## How to Fix

-   **Pod:** Ensure that the `hostPID` field in the Pod specification is set to `false` or not defined (it defaults to `false`).
-   **Other resources (Deployment, DaemonSet, etc):** Ensure that the `hostPID` field in the Pod template specification is set to `false` or not defined.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  hostPID: true
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  hostPID: false # Or remove this line as it defaults to false
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the `hostPID` field in Pod specifications, as well as in the Pod template specifications of controllers like Deployments and DaemonSets.
-   The default value for `hostPID` is `false` if it is not explicitly specified.
-   Consider the security implications carefully before allowing a container to share the host's PID namespace.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on Pod specifications and security best practices.
