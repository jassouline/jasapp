# K8S-SEC-0012 - Avoid Using `hostPort` in Container Specifications

## Description

This rule detects the use of `hostPort` in container specifications within Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets. Using `hostPort` binds a container's port directly to a port on the host node, which can lead to scheduling limitations and potential security concerns.

## Why It Matters

-   **Scheduling Limitations:** When a Pod is bound to a specific `hostPort`, it can only be scheduled on nodes where that port is available. This reduces the number of nodes where the Pod can be placed.
-   **Port Conflicts:** If multiple Pods requiring the same `hostPort` are scheduled on the same node, it will lead to conflicts and prevent some Pods from starting.
-   **Security:** Exposing container ports directly on the host can increase the attack surface if not carefully managed.
-   **Deprecation:** The use of `hostPort` is generally discouraged in favor of more robust and flexible methods like Services.

## How to Fix

-   **Use Services:** In most cases, you should use a Kubernetes Service to expose your application. Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name, and allow you to load balance traffic across multiple Pods.
-   **Remove `hostPort`:** Remove the `hostPort` field from your container specifications.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      hostPort: 8080
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app # Selects pods with the label app=my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80 # Forward traffic to port 80 in the Pod
  type: LoadBalancer
```

## Severity

  - **Low**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of the `hostPort` field within the `ports` section of container and initContainer specifications in various Kubernetes resources.
-   If you must use `hostPort` (e.g., for specific hardware requirements), be sure to understand the implications for scheduling and security.
-   Consider using `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` Services as alternatives to `hostPort` for exposing applications externally.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and [networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/).
