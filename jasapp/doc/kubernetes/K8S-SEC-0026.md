# K8S-SEC-0026 - Avoid Using the Default Service Account

## Description

This rule detects the active use of the `default` service account in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets. It also checks if the `default` service account is used as a subject in `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` resources, and if `automountServiceAccountToken` is not explicitly set to `false` for the `default` service account.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** The `default` service account might have unintended permissions granted to it, especially if RBAC rules were inadvertently applied to it. Using a dedicated service account with minimal permissions reduces the impact of a compromised container.
-   **Least Privilege:** Each application or component should have its own identity (service account) with only the permissions it needs to function. Using the `default` service account violates this principle.
-   **Auditing and Monitoring:** Using specific service accounts makes it easier to audit API access and monitor the behavior of individual applications.

## How to Fix

-   **Create dedicated service accounts:** Create individual service accounts for each application or component in your cluster.
-   **Specify the service account:** Use the `serviceAccountName` field in the Pod specification (or in the Pod template for other resource types) to assign a specific service account to your Pods.
-   **Avoid using `default` in RoleBindings:** Do not use the `default` service account as a subject in `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` resources.
-   **Disable automatic token mounting for `default`:** Set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` for the `default` service account to prevent it from automatically mounting API credentials.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
  # serviceAccountName is not specified, defaults to "default"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: my-role-binding
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default  # Using default service account here
  namespace: my-namespace
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: my-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default  # Default service account
# automountServiceAccountToken is not specified or set to true
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-app-service-account # Use a dedicated service account
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: my-role-binding
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-app-service-account # Use a dedicated service account
  namespace: my-namespace
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: my-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default
automountServiceAccountToken: false # Disable automatic token mounting
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the `serviceAccountName` field in Pod specifications, as well as in the Pod template specifications of controllers like Deployments and DaemonSets.
-   It also checks if the `default` service account is used as a subject in `RoleBinding` and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources.
-   Finally, it checks if the `default` service account has `automountServiceAccountToken` set to `false`.
-   If `serviceAccountName` is not specified, Kubernetes assigns the `default` service account from the same namespace.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [service accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) and [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).
