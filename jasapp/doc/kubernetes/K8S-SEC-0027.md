# K8S-SEC-0027 - Prevent Sharing the Host's Network Namespace

## Description

This rule detects if Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, or ReplicaSets are configured to share the host's network namespace using `hostNetwork: true`. Sharing the host's network namespace allows a container to see and use the host's network interfaces, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing the container to bypass network restrictions.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Sharing the host's network namespace breaks network isolation between containers and the host. A compromised container could gain access to the host's network, communicate with services on the host or on the same network as the host, and potentially attack other systems.
-   **Isolation:** Containers should generally be isolated from the host network to limit the impact of a security breach.
-   **Network Policies:**  Using the host network bypasses Kubernetes network policies, rendering them ineffective.

## How to Fix

-   **Pod:** Ensure that the `hostNetwork` field in the Pod specification is set to `false` or not defined (it defaults to `false`).
-   **Other resources (Deployment, DaemonSet, etc):** Ensure that the `hostNetwork` field in the Pod template specification is set to `false` or not defined.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  hostNetwork: true
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  hostNetwork: false # Or remove this line as it defaults to false
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the `hostNetwork` field in Pod specifications, as well as in the Pod template specifications of controllers like Deployments and DaemonSets.
-   The default value for `hostNetwork` is `false` if it is not explicitly specified.
-   Consider the security implications carefully before allowing a container to share the host's network namespace. This is typically only necessary for specific use cases, such as when a container needs to monitor or manipulate the host's network directly.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on Pod specifications and security best practices.
