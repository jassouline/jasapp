# K8S-SEC-0014 - Minimize Admission of Containers with `NET_RAW` Capability

## Description

This rule detects containers in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets that have the `NET_RAW` capability without explicitly dropping it or dropping `ALL` capabilities. The `NET_RAW` capability allows a container to create raw sockets and bind to any address, which can be misused by malicious containers.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** The `NET_RAW` capability can be used to craft raw packets, potentially leading to IP spoofing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or bypassing network security policies.
-   **Least Privilege:** Containers should only be granted the minimum privileges necessary to perform their intended function.  `NET_RAW` is often not required for typical container workloads.

## How to Fix

-   **Drop `NET_RAW`:** Explicitly drop the `NET_RAW` capability in the `securityContext.capabilities.drop` section of your container specifications.
-   **Drop `ALL`:**  Drop all capabilities using `drop: ["ALL"]` and then add back only those that are strictly necessary. This is the recommended approach for most containers.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_RAW"]
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop: ["NET_RAW"] # Or "ALL"
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Configuration

This rule can be configured to allow the `NET_RAW` capability if needed.  When creating an instance of `K8S_SEC_0014`, you can pass `allowed_net_raw=True`:

```python
rule_instance = K8S_SEC_0014(allowed_net_raw=True)
```

By default, `allowed_net_raw` is set to `False`, meaning the rule will trigger an error if `NET_RAW` is not explicitly dropped.

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of `NET_RAW` in the `securityContext.capabilities.add` field and the absence of `NET_RAW` or `ALL` in the `securityContext.capabilities.drop` field within container specifications.
-   By default, Docker containers run with a limited set of capabilities.  Refer to the Docker documentation for the default list.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [security contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) and [capabilities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container).
-   Refer to the Linux man pages for more information on specific [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).
