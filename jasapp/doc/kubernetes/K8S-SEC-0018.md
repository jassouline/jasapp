# K8S-SEC-0018 - Ensure Seccomp Profile is Set to `RuntimeDefault` or `DockerDefault`

## Description

This rule checks if the seccomp profile is set to `RuntimeDefault` or `DockerDefault` for Pods and containers within Kubernetes resources (Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets). Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) is a Linux kernel feature that allows filtering system calls made by a process. Using the default seccomp profile (`RuntimeDefault` or `DockerDefault`) provides a good balance between security and functionality by restricting potentially dangerous system calls.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security:** Restricting the system calls that a container can make reduces the attack surface and limits the potential damage if a container is compromised.
-   **Least Privilege:** Applying the principle of least privilege, containers should only have access to the system calls they absolutely need. The default seccomp profile disables a number of potentially dangerous system calls.
-   **Compliance:** Some security standards and compliance frameworks may require the use of seccomp profiles.

## How to Fix

-   **Set `seccompProfile.type` (Kubernetes >= 1.19):**  Set the `securityContext.seccompProfile.type` field to `RuntimeDefault` in your Pod or container specifications.
-   **Use Annotations (Kubernetes < 1.19):** For older Kubernetes versions, use the annotation `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` with the value `runtime/default` or `docker/default` at the Pod level.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

### Corrected Manifest (Kubernetes >= 1.19)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      seccompProfile:
        type: RuntimeDefault
```

### Corrected Manifest (Kubernetes < 1.19)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  annotations:
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: "runtime/default"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for `securityContext.seccompProfile.type` being set to `RuntimeDefault` or `DockerDefault` in both Pod and container specifications. It also recognizes the equivalent annotation for older Kubernetes versions.
-   If `securityContext.seccompProfile` is not defined, the behavior depends on the Kubernetes version and the container runtime configuration.
-   You can define custom seccomp profiles, but this is an advanced use case. Ensure you thoroughly understand the implications before using custom profiles.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [seccomp](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/).
