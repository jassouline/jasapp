# K8S-SEC-0028 - Restrict Access to Tiller (Helm V2) from Within the Cluster

## Description

This rule detects if the Tiller deployment (for Helm v2) is accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster. Tiller, the server-side component of Helm v2, interacts directly with the Kubernetes API server to manage resources.  Its default configuration can be overly permissive, granting broad permissions to users.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** If Tiller is accessible from within the cluster, a compromised pod could potentially use the Tiller service account to gain unauthorized access to the cluster and perform malicious actions.
-   **Least Privilege:**  Restricting access to Tiller follows the principle of least privilege, limiting the potential damage from a compromised pod.
-   **Deprecation of Tiller:** Tiller is deprecated in Helm v3, which uses a client-only architecture.

## How to Fix

1.  **Upgrade to Helm v3:** The recommended solution is to upgrade to Helm v3, which eliminates the need for Tiller and its associated security concerns.
2.  **Restrict Tiller's Listener (if using Helm v2):** If you must continue using Helm v2, configure Tiller to listen only on the localhost interface, preventing access from other pods within the cluster.  This can be done by adding the argument `--listen=localhost:44134` to the Tiller deployment.
3. **Remove Tiller Port from Container:** You can also remove the port definition from the tiller container to avoid exposing the port.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tiller-deploy
  labels:
    app: tiller
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tiller
        image: gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller:v2.16.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 44134 # Exposing the Tiller port
          protocol: TCP
```

### Corrected Manifest (Helm v2 with restricted listener)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tiller-deploy
  labels:
    app: tiller
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tiller
        image: gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller:v2.16.9
        args:
        - --listen=localhost:44134  # Restrict Tiller to listen on localhost only
```

### Corrected Manifest (Helm v2 without Tiller port)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tiller-deploy
  labels:
    app: tiller
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tiller
        image: gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller:v2.16.9
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule detects Tiller deployments by checking for deployments named `tiller-deploy`.
-   It checks if the Tiller container is configured to listen on localhost only (using the `--listen=localhost:44134` argument).
-   It also checks if the Tiller container exposes port `44134` without binding it to localhost.
-   It is strongly recommended to upgrade to Helm v3 to avoid the security risks associated with Tiller.
-   Refer to the Helm documentation for more information on [migrating from Helm v2 to Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/).
