# K8S-STX-0005 - Use Image Digests for Immutable Tags

## Description

This rule checks if container images in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets are specified using digests (e.g., `image@sha256:<digest>`) instead of mutable tags (e.g., `image:latest`, `image:v1`). Using image digests ensures that your deployments are immutable and use a specific, verifiable version of an image.

## Why It Matters

-   **Reproducibility:** Using digests ensures that your deployments always use the exact same image, preventing unexpected changes that can occur when tags are updated.
-   **Security:** Digests provide a cryptographic guarantee of the image content, protecting against image tampering or accidental updates.
-   **Reliability:**  Avoids potential issues caused by discrepancies between the image tag and the actual image content.

## How to Fix

-   **Use digests:** When defining your container images, use the image digest instead of a tag.
-   **Resolve digests:**  You can use tools like `docker inspect` or `crane digest` to obtain the digest of a specific image tag.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container-with-tag
    image: my-image:v1.0  # Using a tag
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container-with-digest
    image: my-image@sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 # Using a digest
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of `@sha256:` in the image field of container specifications to determine if a digest is used.
-   Using image digests is the most reliable way to ensure immutability, as tags can be updated or reassigned.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [managing images](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/).
