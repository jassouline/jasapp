# K8S-SEC-0020 - Avoid Deploying Tiller (Helm V2)

## Description

This rule detects the deployment of Tiller, the server-side component of Helm v2, in a Kubernetes cluster. Tiller has known security risks due to its broad permissions and has been superseded by Helm v3, which adopts a client-only architecture.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Tiller typically requires extensive permissions in the cluster to function, making it a high-value target for attackers. If compromised, Tiller could be used to gain control of the entire cluster.
-   **Deprecation:** Tiller is deprecated in Helm v3 and is no longer necessary.
-   **Least Privilege:**  Using Helm v3 without Tiller allows for a more granular and secure approach to managing Helm charts.

## How to Fix

-   **Upgrade to Helm v3:** Migrate to Helm v3, which does not require Tiller. Helm v3 uses a client-only architecture and leverages Kubernetes' built-in RBAC for access control.
-   **Remove Tiller:** If you are still using Helm v2, remove Tiller from your cluster using `helm reset` or `helm reset --force`.
-   **Use Helm v2 without Tiller (if necessary):** If you must use Helm v2, consider using it in a Tillerless configuration, which is less secure than Helm v3 but more secure than running Tiller.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: tiller-pod
  labels:
    app: helm
    name: tiller
spec:
  containers:
  - name: tiller-container
    image: gcr.io/kubernetes-helm/tiller:v2.16.0
```

### Corrected Action

Upgrade to Helm v3 and remove the Tiller deployment.

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule detects the presence of Pods that are likely to be part of a Tiller deployment, based on common labels (`app: helm`, `name: tiller`) and image names (containing `tiller`).
-   Helm v3 offers significant improvements in security and architecture compared to Helm v2.
-   Refer to the Helm documentation for more information on [migrating from Helm v2 to Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/).
