# K8S-SEC-0013 - Avoid Mounting the Docker Socket

## Description

This rule detects if the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted inside a container using a `hostPath` volume in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets. Mounting the Docker socket gives the container access to the Docker daemon on the host, which can be a serious security risk.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** A container with access to the Docker socket can create, modify, and delete other containers, potentially including privileged containers. This can allow an attacker to escape the container and gain control of the host system.
-   **Privilege Escalation:**  Mounting the Docker socket essentially grants the container root access to the host, violating the principle of least privilege.

## How to Fix

-   **Avoid mounting the Docker socket:** Do not mount `/var/run/docker.sock` inside your containers unless absolutely necessary.
-   **Use alternatives:** If you need to interact with the Docker daemon from within a container, consider using dedicated tools like `kaniko`, `img`, or `buildah` that do not require access to the Docker socket.
-   **Review use cases:** Carefully evaluate why you need to access the Docker socket. There are often alternative solutions that don't involve this risky practice.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: docker-socket
    hostPath:
      path: /var/run/docker.sock
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: docker-socket
      mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    # No volume mount for /var/run/docker.sock
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of `/var/run/docker.sock` in the `hostPath.path` field of a volume definition within Pod specifications, as well as in the Pod template specifications of controllers like Deployments and DaemonSets.
-   Mounting the Docker socket is a significant security risk and should be avoided unless there is a very strong justification.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) and [security best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/security-best-practices/).
