# K8S-STX-0001 - Ensure Container Image Tags are Fixed

## Description

This rule checks if container images in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets are using a fixed tag.  A fixed tag is any tag other than `latest` or an empty tag. Using specific tags (e.g., version numbers) for container images is essential for ensuring the reproducibility and stability of your deployments.

## Why It Matters

-   **Reproducibility:** Using fixed tags ensures that your deployments always use the same version of an image, preventing unexpected changes due to image updates.
-   **Stability:**  Avoids the "latest tag" problem, where the image pointed to by `latest` can change unexpectedly, leading to application errors or instability.
-   **Rollback:**  Using specific tags makes it easier to roll back to a previous version of your application.

## How to Fix

-   **Specify a tag:** When defining your container images, always include a specific tag that refers to a particular version of the image.
-   **Avoid `latest`:** Do not use the `latest` tag in production, as it can lead to unpredictable deployments.
-   **Avoid empty tags:** Do not leave the tag empty, as this often defaults to `latest`.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container-with-latest
    image: my-image:latest  # Avoid using :latest
  - name: my-container-with-no-tag
    image: my-image        # Avoid using no tag (defaults to :latest)
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container-with-fixed-tag
    image: my-image:1.2.3   # Use a specific version tag
  - name: my-container-with-digest
    image: my-image@sha256:45b23dee08af5e43a7fea6c4cf9c25ccf269ee5b16175c484744f251a97b8b7a # Use a digest (most reliable)
```

## Severity

  - **Warning**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of a tag that is not `latest` and is not empty.
-   Using image digests (e.g., `my-image@sha256:45b23dee08af5e43a7fea6c4cf9c25ccf269ee5b16175c484744f251a97b8b7a`) is the most reliable way to ensure immutability, but it can be less convenient than using version tags.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on managing images.
