# K8S-SEC-0010 - Restrict Added Capabilities in Containers

## Description

This rule detects containers in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets that have added Linux capabilities beyond a configurable allowed list. Using the Linux capabilities feature, you can grant certain privileges to a process without granting all the privileges of the root user. This rule helps enforce the principle of least privilege by ensuring containers only have the capabilities they absolutely need.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Adding capabilities to containers increases their privileges and widens the attack surface. If a container is compromised, an attacker might be able to leverage these extra capabilities to perform actions they wouldn't otherwise be able to do.
-   **Least Privilege:** Containers should be granted only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their intended function.

## How to Fix

-   **Review needed capabilities:** Carefully evaluate which capabilities your container actually needs.
-   **Specify only required capabilities:**  Use `securityContext.capabilities.add` to add only the specific capabilities required by your application, and ensure they are included in the allowed list for this rule.
-   **Avoid adding unnecessary capabilities:** Do not add capabilities that are not explicitly required by your application.

## Example

Assuming the allowed capabilities are `NET_ADMIN` and `SYS_TIME`:

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_PTRACE"]
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"] # Only add allowed capabilities
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Configuration

This rule is configurable. When creating an instance of `K8S_SEC_0010`, you can pass a list of allowed capabilities:

```python
allowed_caps = ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME", "NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
rule_instance = K8S_SEC_0010(allowed_capabilities=allowed_caps)
```

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the `securityContext.capabilities.add` field within container specifications.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [security contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) and [capabilities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container).
