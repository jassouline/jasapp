# K8S-SEC-0024 - Avoid Granting `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` Capability to Containers

## Description

This rule detects containers in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets that have been granted the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is a powerful capability that allows a wide range of privileged operations, effectively giving the container root-like privileges on the host.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Granting `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` significantly increases the attack surface of your container. If compromised, an attacker could leverage this capability to escape the container and gain control of the host system or perform other malicious actions.
-   **Least Privilege:** Containers should be granted only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their intended function. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` provides far more privileges than most containers need.

## How to Fix

-   **Remove `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`:** If your container does not absolutely require `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, remove it from the `securityContext.capabilities.add` list.
-   **Drop all capabilities and add only what's needed:** A more secure approach is to drop all capabilities using `securityContext.capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` and then add back only those that are strictly necessary for your application.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["CAP_SYS_ADMIN"]
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop: ["ALL"] # Drop all capabilities
        # add: ["CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE"] # Add only specific capabilities if needed
```

## Severity

  - **Error**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` in the `securityContext.capabilities.add` field within container specifications. It also recognizes the capability added with or without the `CAP_` prefix.
-   `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` grants a wide range of privileges, including:
    -   Loading and unloading kernel modules
    -   Setting the system time
    -   Mounting and unmounting filesystems
    -   Modifying network configurations
    -   And many other privileged operations.
-   Very few containers require `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. Carefully evaluate your container's needs before granting this capability.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [security contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) and [capabilities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container).
-   Refer to the Linux man pages for more information on specific [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).
