# K8S-SEC-0002 - Avoid Privileged Containers

## Description

This rule detects the use of privileged containers in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets. Privileged containers have almost all the same capabilities as the host machine's root user, which poses a significant security risk.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** Privileged containers can access and modify host resources, potentially allowing an attacker to escape the container and compromise the host system.
-   **Least Privilege:** Running containers with privileged access violates the principle of least privilege, which states that a process should only have the minimum permissions necessary to perform its function.

## How to Fix

-   **Avoid using `privileged: true`:**  Set `securityContext.privileged` to `false` (or remove it, as `false` is the default) in your container specifications.
-   **Use capabilities:** If your container needs specific capabilities, add them individually using `securityContext.capabilities.add` instead of granting all root privileges.
-   **Run as non-root user:** Use the `securityContext.runAsUser` and `securityContext.runAsGroup` options to run the container as a non-root user.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-privileged-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      privileged: false # Or remove this line, as it defaults to false
      # Add only necessary capabilities if needed:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
      runAsUser: 1000
      runAsGroup: 1000
```

## Severity

  - **High**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the presence of `securityContext.privileged: true` within container specifications.
-   The default value for `privileged` is `false` if it is not explicitly specified.
-   Carefully consider the security implications before granting a container privileged access. Use specific capabilities or run as a non-root user whenever possible.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [security contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) and [capabilities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-capabilities-for-a-container).
