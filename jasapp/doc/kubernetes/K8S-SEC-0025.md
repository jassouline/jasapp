# K8S-SEC-0025 - Ensure Containers Run with a High UID

## Description

This rule checks if containers in Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, and ReplicaSets are configured to run with a high User ID (UID). Specifically, it verifies that the `securityContext.runAsUser` field is set to a value greater than or equal to 10000. Running containers with a high, non-root UID reduces the impact of potential container escape vulnerabilities.

## Why It Matters

-   **Security Risks:** If a container running as a low UID (especially root, UID 0) is compromised, the attacker could potentially gain access to the host system with the same privileges. Using a high UID restricts the attacker's access even if they escape the container.
-   **Least Privilege:**  Containers should be granted only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their intended function. Running with a high, non-root UID helps enforce this principle.

## How to Fix

-   **Set `runAsUser`:** In your container specifications, set the `securityContext.runAsUser` field to a value greater than or equal to 10000.
-   **Create a dedicated user:** Ideally, create a dedicated user with a high UID in your Dockerfile and use that user in your Kubernetes manifests.

## Example

### Manifest Triggering the Rule

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000 # Low UID
```

### Corrected Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 10000 # High UID
```

## Severity

  - **Info**

## Other Relevant Information

-   This rule checks for the `securityContext.runAsUser` field within container specifications and `initContainer` specifications.
-   It considers any UID less than 10000 as potentially unsafe. You might need to adjust this threshold based on your specific environment and security policies.
-   It is also recommended to set `securityContext.runAsNonRoot` to `true` to prevent the container from running as the root user, even if `runAsUser` is not explicitly specified.
-   Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on [security contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).
